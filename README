This is a project developed for a introduction course to Compilers taught at Reykjavík University in the spring of 2010.

The project is threefold:
	1 - Create a lexical analyzer for a subset of the Pascal programming language.
	2 - Create a parser to parse input files according to the given BNF grammar.
	3 - Create a TAC (Three Address Code) generator.

We decided to implement our project in the Python programming language.
